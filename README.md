This a robotic arm with a 4 DOF developed based on MeArm model for further development. Take a look at my BOM and assembly drawing PDF to build the same model.

</br> PLAN FOR THE FURTURE:

Currently, the 3D printing process is inaccurate, making it challenging for some parts to move into place. I'm attempting to redesign and rebuild the claw section using laser cutting. 


</br> EXAMPLE DEVELOPMENT:

- Control by phone with the HC-06 Bluetooth module
